        By clicking on the links to the passages at the right of each table below, you can access text fully diagrammed and analyzed sentence by sentence, where every word, clause, and phrase is morphologically identified, syntactically labeled, and connected to the word or structure that it modifies: <b>a treebank</b>.  This is a resource for making even the most complex Latin transparent, allowing students of the language at all levels to work toward a full appreciation of the semantic nuance of the texts. <br/><br/>
        The treebanked textal commentaries available through this portal are the ongoing publication of collaborative work beginning in fall of 2011 with students at Tufts University ranging from those in the 3rd semester to those in the most advanced graduate seminars in Latin.  After each semester ended, I (M. Harrington) edited and combined their work, resulting in the current  treebanked commentaries published within this project. <br/><br/>At the bottom of the page, you can download in pdf form instructions for navigating the treebanks and my complete <i>Synopsis of Latin Grammar</i> and my <i>Synopsis of Greek Grammar</i>, with explanations and examples of the morphology and syntax of Ancient Latin and Ancient Greek - arranged in the same order as the syntactic relationship menu of the treebanking interface.

        Each of these treebanked commentaries on an ancient text represents a semester of immersive study within a dedicated course.  While closely reading the texts, students intensively debated particular instances of constructions and usages and by doing so came to understand the structural differences between, for example, a <i>Dative of Interest</i> and a <i>Dative of Reference</i> or between a <i>Purpose Clause</i> and a <i>Clause of Comparison</i>.  In each instance, their cumulative final project was to independently complete a treebanked commentary of their assigned portion of the text.  After each semester ended, I (M. Harrington) edited and combined their work, resulting in the current treebanked commentaries published within this project. As an Example: In the spring semester of 2015, as part of an Latin 3 course on the <i>Satyricon</i> of Petronius and the <i>Res Gestae Divi Augusti</i>, five undergraduate students collaborated under my supervision to fully analyze the Latin text of the <i>Res Gestae Divi Augusti</i>.

        <h3>JUVENAL TREEBANKING PROJECT</h3><br/>
        During research for my dissertaion, “<i></i>Mens Sana</i>: Authorized Emotions and the Construction of Identity and Deviance in the <i>Saturae</i> of Juvenal,” I became very familiar with the stylistics of the author, but the process of treebanking the text has led to a much clearer understanding of the powerful intersections between content and structure.

        These Synopses of Ancient Latin and Greek Grammar are designed to maximize clarity and usability, and they use the same organization, terminology, and even color coding of morphemes in the paradigms to allow the significant and extensive parallels in the syntax and morphology of Latin and Greek to be as explicit as possible.  Both texts are written from the perspective of the linguistic approach of dependency grammar emphasizing the functional role of morphosyntax is constructing the semantic force of each sentence.<br/><br/>

         <h3>About the Project</h3><br/>
         Like the <b>Perseids Project</b> of Tufts University itself, this project grows directly from the pioneering work in the Digital Humanities of Professor Gregory Crane, editor of the <b>Perseus Project</b> at Tufts University. The Perseus Project continues to make ancient texts freely accessible to the world and provides powerful tools to facilitate engagement with those texts. Built on this foundation, these treebanked commentaries identify not just what morphological form an individual word might be, but clearly indicate precisely what form a word IS and both identify and visualize that word's exact syntactic relationship with all of the other words and structures within the sentence. <br/><br/> 
         In addition to allowing students of the ancient languages to contribute meaningfully to ongoing research from their third semester of study, this project is designed to make possible collaboration between all levels of study and instruction within the broader field of the Classics.  It is my hope that students and instructors from middle school to graduate study will find these treebanked commentaries and their associated Synopses of Latin and Greek Grammar a powerful tool for making deep engagement with the original texts both more precise and efficient.
